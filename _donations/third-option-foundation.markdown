title:  "Third Option Foundation Donations"
---
Our Cardano [ADA for Warriors](https://4wardpool.swiftcryptollc.com){:target="_blank"} pool (4WARD) donates 50% of the pool operator rewards to the [Third Option Foundation](https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}.  Donations are made during the last epoch of each month that our pool was active.

The Third Option Foundation was chosen because they fill the gap for our fallen and injured CIA operators and their families. Their assistance can be in the form of financial and logistical support, academic and college prep for children, home maintenance, counseling and family services, physical health and wellness support, legacy activities to honor fallen warriors, and the establishment of memorials.

If you want to help honor the sacrifices they've made for our country, please delegate with our 4WARD pool to increase it's chance of being active for each Cardano epoch.
