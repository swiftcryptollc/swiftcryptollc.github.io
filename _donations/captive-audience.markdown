Our Cardano [ADA for Warriors (4WARD)](https://4wardpool.swiftcryptollc.com){:target="_blank"} pool donates 25% of the pool operator rewards to [Captive Audience](https://www.captiveaudienceptrt.com/){:target="_blank"}.  Donations are made during the last epoch of each month that our pool was active.

Captive Audience was created to provide security, travel, self-defense, firearms, and survival courses designed to develop the skills needed to maintain situational awareness and survive in kidnapping, extortion, active shooter, natural disaster, and crisis situations at home and abroad.

Requests for their services have spiked since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. This spike has created a huge gap in the funding required to provide the necessary training and supplies for those directly impacted by the devastation of this invasion. 

For more information on the relationship between our ADA for Warriors pool and Captive Audience, please read our [donation announcement](/news/2022-03-31-captive-audience/){:target="_blank"}.
