title:  "ADA for Warriors"
---
We're excited to announce that our 4WARD pool has been re-branded to better reflect the mission that it supports.
<br /><br />
Initially our pool was named after our small business, Swift Crypto LLC.  Our focus was on securing the right hardware, securing the servers themselves, and tweaking the OS settings to make sure our pool servers were running smoothly 24/7.  Marketing was done through various social media posts, but it became apparent that something was missing.  What was missing was the "hook"...
<br /><br />
The original pool name didn't give a person any idea about what the pool supports.  In order for us to support the [Third Option Foundation's](https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} mission, we have to hook people.  We need people to read the name and want to learn more about it.  We want to attract like-minded individuals who understand the sacrifices that are made and want to make a difference in this world.
<br/><br/>
With some thought, the "Swift Crypto LLC" pool is now named the [ADA for Warriors](https://4wardpool.swiftcryptollc.com){:target="_blank"} pool.  The '4WARD' ticker will remain the same, as our goal is to help members of this community, and their families, to move forward through their troubled times.  We are also changing the variable fee from 3% to 0% in order to attract new delegates.
<br /><br />
We truly hope these changes will be the start of a new growth opportunity for this mission.
<br /><br />
