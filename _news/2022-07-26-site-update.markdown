title:  "Major Site Changes"
---
<br> 
When Swift Crypto was started, it was simply an Ethereum mining business.  As time went on, it was expanded to run a Cardano pool, [ADA for Warriors](https://4wardpool.swiftcryptollc.com){:target="_blank"}.  The majority of the news after that point had to do with our pool and Cardano.  It got to the point where it no longer made sense to keep that news here on the main business website.  So the ADA for Warriors site undertook a major rework!  All of the mission and donation information can now be found over there along with all of the Cardano community envolvement we have (FreeLoaderz, SmartClaimz, Mehen, Project Catalyst to name a few).  We'll still post news here from time to time but I suspect that most of our news will be more relevant to our pool website!
