title:  "First Cardano Blocks Minted"
---
As a fairly new small single pool, it's difficult to compete with the large corporate pools and the pools that have been around for a few years.  The pledge costs in 2021 were easily 5 to 10 times the cost of 2020 (let alone the years before that!).  Even so, we believe in Cardano and we believe in our mission.  Cardano's recent growth spurt of wallets and smart contracts, along with the network performance changes and the potential of [Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/03/implementing-hydra-heads-the-first-step-towards-the-full-hydra-vision/){:target="_blank"}, paints a promising picture for the furture of Cardano.   

We still have a long way to go to reach our goals, but during Epoch 318, we minted our first 2 blocks.  Those two blocks resulted in ~369 ADA operator rewards and ~935 ADA rewards for our delegates.  Our ROA for that epoch was a massive **30.663%** and it put our lifetime ROA to **8.206%**.  To support our mission to donate to the Third Option Foundation, ~185 ADA has been earmarked to be donated during the last epoch of February.

We hope that this is the start of many donations to this unique non-profit organization.  We are extremely thankful for our current delegates and their commitment, but we need more help.  We need your help.  Please visit our [ADA for Warriors](https://4wardpool.swiftcryptollc.com/){:target="_blank"} website for more information about the Third Option Foundation and our pool.  We hope that you will join us in helping to honor the sacrifice that these warriors and their families have made for our country.
