title:  "April/May Update: Donations, SmartClaimz, and ZiberBugs!"
---
<br> 
So I thought we were busy in March, but that was nothing compared to April and May.  There's a lot going on, so let's get caught up!
<br><br> 

### Donation Updates ###
We had terrible luck in April, but May has been pretty good.  We have 3 blocks in the last 3 epochs (2 this past epoch).  One March block was paid in April.  That reward was 340 ADA, 170 of which was donated to the [Third Option Foundation](https://www.thirdoptionfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}.  That brings our 2022 total donation to the Third Option Foundation to $704.70.

Our April donation of 85 ADA to [Captive Audience](https://www.captiveaudienceptrt.com/){:target="_blank"} is on hold for now.  They are setting up a hardware wallet for the donation.  Hopefully that'll be ready soon and those donations can start rolling out.  They are doing incredible work with the Ukraine situation.  If you have time, please read up on what they are doing.

I still have copies of Captive Audience's Prevention Training and Recovery Team's [365 Days of Survival](https://www.amazon.com/365-Days-Survival-Foundational-Critical/dp/1792108974){:target="_blank"} book.  If you are one of our current delegators or you are a new delegator with us and you want a copy of the book, please reach out to us via email at [info@swiftcryptollc.com](mailto:info@swiftcryptollc.com) or through [telegram](https://t.me/SwiftCryptoLLC).  We'll need your staking key and an address to send the book to.  (Feel free to use a virtual PO Box or something similar as your address instead of your home address.)  We'll send you a copy of the book free of charge as a thank you for helping support ADA for Warriors and our missions.

### FreeLoaderz/SmartClaimz Update ###

We are working in conjuction with FreeLoaderz to create a new token claiming platform for Cardano named [SmartClaimz](https://rwd.freeloaderz.io){:target="_blank"}.  It's currently available on Testnet.  The system has been running smoothly for about a month now.  In preparation of Mainnet though, the back end is being reworked to support auto-scaling through kubernetes.  We don't know exactly how much load we'll get, but we want to be prepared.

We were on [Sgt Crypto's](https://twitter.com/J94821069?s=20&t=t6dL-ZP8TUPgdBGHpIhDuw){:target="_blank"} Mint Monday Twitter Space last Thursday (May 19th) talking about SmartClaimz.  You can listen to the recording on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SwiftCryptoLLC/status/1527440421420507136?s=20&t=t6dL-ZP8TUPgdBGHpIhDuw){:target="_blank"}.  We come on during the last hour or so of the show.  We talked about our Load Balancers along with SmartClaimz.  We laid out our vision for the platform and where we want to go with it all.  It was a great piece.  A huge shout out to Sgt Crypto and his gang for giving us the opportunity to be a part of their show!

Next week on May 24th 10 AM EST, we'll be doing an AMA with [Cardano over Coffee](https://twitter.com/coc_space?s=20&t=t6dL-ZP8TUPgdBGHpIhDuw){:target="_blank"}.  If you have questions, this will be the place to do it.

There still is some functionality that is being working on.  A big one will be the ability to delegate to a participating pool directly on the SmartClaimz site.  Other functionality includes being able to read about the participating projects and their tokens on the site.  Ultimately, that'll allow our users to make a much more informed decision about the pool they want to delegate to and what projects to support.  

If everything goes well, SmartClaimz should be live on Mainnet by the end of June/beginning of July.

### ZiberBugs ###

This one wasn't expected, but I'm excited to announce that our ADA for Warriors pool has been selected to be a part of [ZiberBugs](https://ziberbugs.io/){:target="_blank"}, an upcoming Play 2 Earn NFT Autobattler on Cardano.  There are 9 different bugs (teams) within the game.  We are a part of the Sentinal team.

What is it all about?  Well...

### Next Month ###
Over this next month, we'll be working with Captive Audience so we can send their donations to their Cardano wallet.  It would be great to be able to get the Third Option Foundation to do something similar.  We truly do hate selling in this current market.  Ideally, the ADA could be held for a little while for, hopefully, a better market.

SmartClaimz will take up a lot of our time as we prepare for Mainnet and ZiberBugs will as well.  It's definitely an exciting time to be in the Cardano space.
